# Customer-and-Potential-Customer-Dashboard

The first dashboard is showing the sales performance of each product category, USA customers origin, their age group and gender. 

This dashboard allow management to drill down from product and customer aspect to understand their relationship. Here are some example of the insights that we can get from this dashboard:

1. What is the total sales average sales and number of customers from specific part of USA?

2. What are the most popular and least popular product category and their customer age group, gender and origin?

3. What are the major and least number customer characteristics (age group and gender and their origin) in relation to sales performance?

The second dashboard is to determine the target customer to send invitation email regarding an environment campaign. The data is gathered from a survey questionaire conducted by the company. A snapshot of the questions can be found in the GitHub repository.

We have use a filter to select Answer 3 of the Question 2 as our analysis target because the respondents are the environmental lovers. This satisfied the aim of the analysis. Due to more than 50% of the respondents are female from age 18-45 year old. Thus, we have grouped it as our sample customer population and then further drilled down byy state. If the company has limited budget and want to have high return of investment (ROI), they should focus on female age 18-25 year old and live in New York City, instead of targeting on the majority female environmental lovers.

Both of the dashboards are constructed using Tableau.
